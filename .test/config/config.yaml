gfold:

    B-1_vs_A-1:
      # `baseline` and `changed` need to specify existing "{sample}-{unit}"
      # combinations, as available from the kallisto output (and as usually
      # specified in the units.tsv). Fold changes are computed by comparing
      # the value of `changed` against the value of `baseline`.
