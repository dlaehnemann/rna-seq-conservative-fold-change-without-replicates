Enrichment of {{snakemake.wildcards.enrichr_library}} in the contrast of sample {{snakemake.wildcards.sample_changed}}-{{snakemake.wildcards.unit_changed}} against sample {{snakemake.wildcards.sample_baseline}}-{{snakemake.wildcards.unit_baseline}}. Enrichment was performed with GSEApy, using a hypergeometric test for the null hypothesis that the genes in the gene set are independent of the significantly differentially expressed genes. The background was adjusted for the set of measured genes in the panel.
